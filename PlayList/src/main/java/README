# Project 2: Play List

* Author: Henry J. Schade
* Class: CS 121 Section 004
* Semester: Fall 2016
* Project Name: PlayList

## Overview
Java program that manages a user's songs in a simplified playlist.
An input.txt file should have been provided (for automated testing), but any can be used if a line is added 
to the begining with the character 8 in it.


## Compiling and Using
Do the following from the command line and in the Project directory.
Compile using: 
	"javac [Project Name]".
Run using: 
	"java [Project Name]"
or
	"java [Project Name] < input.txt"


## Discussion
The issues I ran into were all mainly related to doing things above and beyond what was called for.
ArrayLists took a bit for me to figure out how to initialize (properly), for some reason.

I initially got confused, by the instructions, as I was finishing step 2.
Both step 1 and 2 were easy, but no where did the instructions indicated "read/get X number of songs", 
so when I finished w/ step 2 (to read one song), I cleaned up my code then went to move on to step 3 and 
the note before step one stopped me in my tracks.  So I double checked the Extra Credit section, and it 
had all the steps/features I felt were a MUST for something like this.

The sorting was a bit of a challenge, probably because I wanted to sort the ArrayList as a collection, and 
not create a new list as I itterated through the current list.  I'm pretty sure I understand the Comparator() 
methods/routines, but I won't sware to it.  I'm also not sure why the 4 I created, and more if I wanted to do 
each field, are not all under one Comparator() with a unique method, 4 in my case, at the compare() level.  I 
also suspect they really should be in the Song class.

Added option 8 into the menu, after asking about the automated testing process in class.

Writing, and reading, a file were a bit tricky.  I've delt with data streams in other languages, so thought 
it would be pretty easy, but the initial examples I found seamed to have extra steps in the process that just 
made things confusing.  Trying to read a file with a data stream was even more complicated than writting to a 
file.  Thankfully I remembered, and found samples about how to use scanner to read a file.


## Extra Credit (5 points)
You may notice that you are repeating the same code to read in the song data from the user for each 
song (Yuck! This would get really messy if we had 10 songs).
Modify your main method to use a loop to read in the songs from the user. As you read and create new 
songs, you will need to store your songs in an ArrayList.
This can be quite challenging if you have never used ArrayLists before, so we recommend saving a backup 
of your original implementation before attempting the extra credit.
